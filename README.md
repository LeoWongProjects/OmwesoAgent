# Omweso Agent

## Synopsis

Omweso is a board game part of a family of other variants in the Mancala family, originating from the people of Uganda. The game is played on a board with 4 rows and 8 columns of pits, where seeds are initially placed and sowed throughout the game. Each player begins with 32 seeds which can be placed in any conformation they deem strategical in their corresponding 2 x 8 grid of pits. Following the preliminary setup with all 32 seeds of each player positioned in the pits of the board, the game begins. The player decides on the move to be played, which consists of picking up all the seeds from one pit containing more than 1 seed on their side of the board, and sowing them in a counter-clockwise manner, until there are no more seeds in that set. At this point, the player's turn could end, relay sowing could follow or a capture could occur. The ultimate goal of the game is to capture the opponent's seeds such that no more moves can be made, meaning that all of the opponent's pits contain 1 seed or less.
